Privacy Policy for Word Meaning Popup Extension
Effective Date: 25-12-2024

1. Overview
  The Word Meaning Popup Extension is designed to enhance your browsing experience by providing instant word definitions when you double-click on any word in a webpage.
  This extension respects your privacy and does not collect or store any personal data.

2. Data Collection and Usage
  No Personal Data Collection: This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or identifiable information.
  Selected Text: When you double-click a word, the extension temporarily processes the selected text to fetch its meaning using an external dictionary API (e.g., Free Dictionary API).
                 The selected text is not stored or shared beyond this purpose.
  API Usage: The extension communicates with third-party dictionary services to retrieve word definitions. These services operate under their respective privacy policies, and the extension does not control or manage their data handling practices.

3. Permissions
  This extension requests the following permissions:
    Active Tab:   To detect double-clicks and process the selected word on the currently active tab.
    Host Permissions: To ensure functionality across webpages where users may use the extension.
  These permissions are solely used to enable the extension's core functionality and do not allow access to your browsing history or personal data.

4. External Links
    The extension may direct you to external websites (e.g., dictionary sources) for additional information.
     Please note that these websites operate independently and have their own privacy policies.
   
5. Changes to this Privacy Policy
    This privacy policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the extension’s functionality or applicable regulations.
    Users are encouraged to review this policy regularly.

   
Since your extension does not explicitly collect or store user data but interacts with selected text and external APIs, you still need a privacy policy to explain its behavior and reassure users. Below is a template for your privacy policy:
